This significant legislation created a consistent approach towards data protection across Europe, and grants EU citizens &amp; residents more control over their personal data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At OpenWeb, we decided to take a proactive and wholesome approach in complying with the GDPR, and have taken this opportunity to enhance the privacy of our entire userbase – not only in the EU but worldwide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to maintaining internal and external policies and procedures to ensure and reflect our compliance, we developed tools and features to make it easier for our users to exercise the rights available to data subjects under the GDPR – regardless of their location. These tools also help us to better serve our media partners all over the world, as we enable them to build independent, thriving communities while keeping with global privacy standards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While our services are offered to website publishers and media partners, our users are in fact the readers and commenters of such partners.

Such use is done by our moderation team (in order to address and prevent any malicious behavior from reoccurring on different websites), and our advertising team (that aggregates user information from multiple partners to provide them with more suitable advertisements). In order to effectively engage in such activity, OpenWeb is required to maintain discretion with regards to personal data of its users, and will therefore typically assume the role of Data Controller with respect to such data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other instances, OpenWeb will act as the Data Processor of users&#8217; personal data, meaning that we will process such users&#8217; data on behalf of our partner. If we are then approached by a user whose data we process on a partner’s behalf, we will refer such user to the relevant partner – who is the Controller of their data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cross-border data transfers:</strong> OpenWeb relies on appropriate legal mechanisms for cross-border transfers of personal data originating in the EEA, such as transferring only to “adequate” jurisdictions which were found to provide a sufficient level of data protection (like Israel), and by self-certifying and adhering to the principles of the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Data Protection Officer (DPO):</strong> our DPO is responsible for monitoring and advising on our ongoing privacy compliance, as well as serving as a point of contact on privacy matters for data subjects and supervisory authorities. Our DPO, Mr. Aner Rabinovitz of <a href=\"http://www.privacyteam.com/\">PrivacyTeam</a>, can be reached at <a href=\"mailto:dpo@openweb.com\">dpo@openweb.com</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>EU Representative:</strong> Our EU representative (a GDPR requirement, under Article 27),</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Andreas Mätzler, can be reached at: Schellinggasse 3/10, Vienna 1010, Austria.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Children data: </strong>&nbsp;no, nope, no-thank-you! OpenWeb does not direct its services to children under the age of 16, and does not knowingly collect data relating to children.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>To Sum Things Up</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We care about your privacy!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We care about your privacy!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have any questions or comments regarding our privacy practices, or if you would like to exercise any of the privacy and data rights available to you, please feel free to reach out to us at <a href=\"mailto:privacy@openweb.com\">privacy@openweb.com</a>&nbsp;or directly to our DPO at <a href=\"mailto:dpo@openweb.com\">dpo@openweb.com</a>.</p>\n","uri":"/legal-and-privacy/gdpr-resource-page/","id":"cG9zdDozMzM3","menuOrder":15,"language":{"slug":"en"},"seo":{"canonical":"https://wordpress.openweb.com/legal-and-privacy/gdpr-resource-page/","title":"|","metaDesc":"","focuskw":"","metaRobotsNoindex":"index","metaRobotsNofollow":"follow","opengraphAuthor":"","opengraphDescription":"The General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individual citizens of the European Union and the European Economic Area.","opengraphTitle":"|","opengraphImage":{"sourceUrl":"https://www.openweb.com/uploads/2020/05/image-european@3x.png"},"opengraphUrl":"https://wordpress.openweb.com/legal-and-privacy/gdpr-resource-page/","opengraphSiteName":"OpenWeb","opengraphPublishedTime":"","opengraphModifiedTime":"2020-12-17T07:03:19+00:00","twitterTitle":"","twitterDescription":"","twitterImage":null},"featuredImage":{"node":{"id":"cG9zdDozMzM4","altText":"","sourceUrl":"https://www.openweb.com/uploads/2020/05/image-european@3x.png","title":"image-european@3x","srcSet":null,"sizes":"(max-width: 246px) 100vw, 246px","mediaDetails":{"width":246,"height":240}}},"privacyPolicyMeta":{"fieldGroupName":"privacyPolicyMeta","bannerOption":{"fieldGroupName":"banner_option","headline":"OpenWeb & the GDPR","subHeadline":"Last revised at: August 11th, 2020"},"contentList":{"fieldGroupName":"content_list","list":null},"ctaOption":{"fieldGroupName":"cta_option","link":null}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["199889258","2615726974","2938868345"]}
