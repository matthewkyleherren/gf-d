Due to the nature of our services and our efforts to create a community free of hate speech or toxic behavior, certain parts of the information shared with us (e.g. your IP address) may be used to help promote the safety and growth of our community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(2) Direct signup – prior to posting your first comment via our service, you may sign-up to our service, either by submitting your name, e-mail and (hashed) password, or by connecting your social media account (in which case you will also share with us your public profile picture(. In such cases, OpenWeb will act as a <strong><em>Business</em></strong> who processes consumer information alongside the publisher, who will be acting as <em>Business</em> as well. Due to the nature of our services, certain requirements of the CCPA will only be accessible via our conversation widget, rather than our own website (such as the “Do-Not-Sell-My-data” button).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why &amp; What does OpenWeb do with your Personal Information? </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We collect personal information for the following purposes:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Personalization </strong>– To provide and operate our services, to verify and authenticate our users, and to provide our users with a personalized user experience (for example: suggesting content that is relevant to you based on your past interests).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Advertising </strong>–Some of our partners use our services to gain an additional adverting-based revenue stream, and use personal information such as IP address and advertising ID to provide you with better and personalized advertising experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Service Improvement, Research &amp; Analytics </strong>–We use aggregated, non-identifiable user information to further develop, customize and improve our service based on common preferences and uses, as well as for statistical and research purposes both for our internal use and for the use of our partners.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Security and Protecting Rights </strong>–We may use and disclose your personal information (e.g. IP address) to investigate violations and enforce our &amp; our partners’ policies for free speech, to reduce fake news and avoid spam and malicious behavior. <strong>Communications </strong>–We may use your information to communicate with you – for example, we will use your contact details to respond to your queries or feedback, and to provide you with technical assistance and support.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Your rights under the CCPA</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The CCPA provides Californians with the following rights:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Requests for information</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>please see the instructions below on how to receive a copy of your personal information from our conversation extension:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your Right to Opt out of Sales</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We enable users from the State of California to exercise their right to request that we do not “sell” their personal information. In OpenWeb’s case, this will only apply to the use of targeted advertising, and once we receive and verify that the request is valid and indeed filed by a California resident, we will take steps to refrain from providing them with targeted, personalized ads (note however that this does not mean that we will not show ads at all).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To update your AdChoices Opt Out settings, select your region&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.youronlinechoices.eu/\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your Right to Notification</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Please visit our <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/legal-and-privacy/privacy/\">Privacy policy</a>&nbsp;for further details regarding our data processing activity under the CCPA</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Nondiscrimination for exercising your CCPA Rights</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The CCPA prohibits businesses from discriminating against you for exercising your rights under the law. Needless to say, OpenWeb will never discriminate against you for choosing to exercise your rights.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Your Right to Delete Personal Information</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow the instructions below to permanently delete your personal information from our system:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Please be advised that due to the nature of our services, when requesting to delete your information from SSO integrated partners/publishers, you will need to submit your request directly with the selected partner prior to exercising your right with us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Contact information</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our Data Protection Officer (DPO), Mr. Aner Rabinovitz of <a href=\"http://www.privacyteam.com/\">PrivacyTeam</a>, is your point of contact for any privacy related questions or concerns.
