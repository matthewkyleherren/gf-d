At that time we talked about how the new investment would be used to build more, better tools for publishers to create direct relationships with their audiences and to improve online conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we&#8217;re delighted to announce that we&#8217;ve acquired Hive Media—a leading expert in publisher technology. Onboarding their incredible expertise is a major step toward enhancing our tools and empowering publishers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Hive&#8217;s technology, we&#8217;ll expand our ability to build and test innovative tools that power first-party data-driven audience relationships, building impactful editorial tools, and increasing the long term value for publishers. Hive’s team brings best-in-class expertise in session optimization, user acquisition, and SEO tools—and we couldn&#8217;t be more excited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bringing Hive Media into the OpenWeb family propels our growth, adding more than 60 new team members, primarily across product and engineering. Additionally, Guy Yeshua and Stacy Aabraham will remain as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Officer, respectively, of Hive, with Yeshua joining our executive leadership team. This means that OpenWeb’s global team is now more than 225 across its offices in New York, Tel Aviv, Kiev, and California.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenWeb and Hive Media have long been close strategic allies, and share a purpose: to empower publishers to be successful. Together, we will  move closer to fulfilling our mission to save online conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you’re a publisher working with us, or with Hive Media, and have any questions at all please reach out to your main point of contact. We&#8217;d love to chat and explore further opportunities. If you&#8217;re not working with us yet, it&#8217;s great time to start—<a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/contact/\">contact us</a>.</p>\n","owHidePublishDate":false,"seo":{"canonical":"https://wordpress.openweb.com/openweb-builds-on-commitment-to-empowering-publishers-through-tech-acquires-hive-media/","title":"OpenWeb Builds on Commitment to Empowering Publishers Through Tech; Acquires Hive Media | OpenWeb","metaDesc":"Our team is delighted to announce and welcome Hive Media Group into the OpenWeb family.
