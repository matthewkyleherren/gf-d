Publishers fill Facebookâ€™s billions of Newsfeeds with content, but they arenâ€™t compensated for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Australia, the <a href=\"https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/digital-platforms/news-media-bargaining-code\">News Media and Digital Platforms Mandatory Bargaining Code</a> aimed to change that by requiring that Facebook and Google pay publishers to display their content. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/17/business/media/australia-google-pay-for-news.html\">Google paid up</a>, but Facebook refused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Facebook Booted News in Australia</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of paying, Facebook instead opted to remove all news content on their platform in Australia. Users couldnâ€™t share links from news sites in Australia, or internationally. Australian news organizations with Facebook pages were completely blocked.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/klCjOxImvNxrDhiikNTal30C91I8mlHSL8GlQAWd6xL99ksaoiUUgftoR7CXnDCuorgZcIjqXZCUQjeuN20Z235L0vX5bMCqxR1aWsDgUX0weOK6iT42Wum0rqerFVL1ovfuy5-K\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Facebook inadvertently banned some non-news websites, too. People were outraged.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Facebook has SHUT DOWN a state health department during a pandemic and I&#39;m not sure I have words to describe how shortsighted and harmful this is. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/facebooknewsban?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#facebooknewsban</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/9ASHk4AnkG\">pic.twitter.com/9ASHk4AnkG</a></p>&mdash; Jen Dudley-Nicholson (@jendudley) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jendudley/status/1362174915957256192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 17, 2021</a></blockquote><script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Facebook Reverses the Ban</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This week, Facebook â€“ seemingly content with the scale of their display of power over the industry â€“ <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/facebook-to-lift-australia-news-ban-32530d572c541098d853d475cb318a0d\">reversed the ban</a>, announcing that they struck a deal with the Australian government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hereâ€™s the kicker: Facebook can decide <a href=\"https://thenewdaily.com.au/news/national/2021/02/23/facebook-morrison-deal/\">how much they pay</a> each news outlet. They also reserve the right to ban news again, if they choose.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Donâ€™t kid yourself &#8230;.

Publishers, like influencers or celebrities, are expected to build up an audience on the social platforms, and to use the platformâ€™s publishing tools to reach them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is already problematic as Facebook, among other platforms, are known to change their sorting algorithms on a whimâ€“exposing or hiding your content from your audience on the platforms.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the Australian news ban shows just how far they are willing to go to protect a business model that hinges on the monetization of Publishersâ€™ content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This whole episode has made it clear: <strong>if youâ€™re a Publisher, Facebook is not your friend. </strong>Or at least, they shouldnâ€™t be your only friend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A continued reliance on social media is dangerous: publishers who do so are missing out on directly monetizing their audience, passing over valuable first-party dataâ€”a critical key to success in our <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/a-new-frontier-of-publisher-monetization/\">cookieless future</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Can Publishers Do Now?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To build a sustainable business model, publishers will need to find ways to step between users and social platforms, own the relationship with their readers, and provide high-quality community-based experiences powered by tested and proven engagement funnels. OpenWebOS does all of this, and connects these user insights to advertisers, providing context-driven monetization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about OpenWebOSâ€™ engagement funnels, <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/the-path-to-user-loyalty-and-lifetime-value/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">click here</a>.</p>\n","owHidePublishDate":false,"seo":{"canonical":"https://wordpress.openweb.com/publishers-facebook-is-not-your-friend/","title":"Facebookâ€™s News Ban is a Wake-Up Call for Publishers | OpenWeb","metaDesc":"","focuskw":"","metaRobotsNoindex":"index","metaRobotsNofollow":"follow","opengraphAuthor":"","opengraphDescription":"Last week, Facebook cut off all news for an entire country.
