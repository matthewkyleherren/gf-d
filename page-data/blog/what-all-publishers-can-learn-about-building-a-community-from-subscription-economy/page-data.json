Ad revenue isn’t going anywhere—nor should it. But building a community willing to pay is no small task: there are some valuable lessons here on how to build a loyal and committed community that all publishers can learn from.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the top of the list? <strong>Registered and subscribed users are a valuable source of first-party data</strong>. Many publishers are also using the subscription model to achieve sustainability, retention, and increase the LTV of their users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since it doesn&#8217;t appear that the subscription model is going away any time soon, publishers should be aware of why it’s expanded so rapidly, and what this could mean for your business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this post, I’ll examine why the subscription economy has blown up over the past year and what all Publishers – even those who will always remain ad-supported – can learn to help drive registrations, returning users, and greater sustainability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What can publishers learn from the subscription model?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to<a href=\"https://www.emarketer.com/content/subscriptions-will-grow-in-importance\"> eMarketer</a>, subscriptions are one of the biggest digital trends of 2021. More industries are leveraging subscriptions because it’s a powerful way to take advantage of notable shifts in consumer buying habits. For instance, a <a href=\"https://www.zuora.com/resource/the-end-of-ownership/\">recent report from Zuora</a> revealed that people increasingly favor experiences and services over physical products.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content upgrades, as well as access to premium and exclusive content are some of the top reasons why users hit the subscribe button on a publisher’s website.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember, it’s all about value: registered and subscribed users are your biggest fans, and they will keep coming back over time, allowing publishers to drive loyalty and increase user LTV. And since these users also<a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/election-focused-products-charge-u-s-growth-at-the-economist/\"> tend to be more engaged</a>, the subscription model helps create stronger relationships between the publisher and the reader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why is this crucial for publishers to know?</strong> Readers who sign up to become a part of your community are a valuable source of first-party data—an absolute necessity in the forthcoming <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/the-death-of-the-third-party-cookie-why-now-is-the-time-to-plan-your-first-party-data-strategy/\">cookieless world</a>. First-party data delivers insights that help better align the right advertisers with your users, and even helps inform editorial decisions with data like trending topics and overall engagement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Readers who sign up also have a sense of belonging in the community, so it’s no surprise that they are the most loyal users who return frequently and spend more time on-site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, it’s easy to see why leading publishers have embraced the subscription model. But you may be thinking, “I’m not the New York Times. How would this work for my business?”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The subscription model isn’t for all publishers—but driving readers to sign up is important</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Paid subscriptions may not make sense for every publisher, and that’s more than OK. But encouraging your readers to sign up and become a part of your community is non-negotiable. Not only do you get valuable first-party data; registered, engaged users keep coming back to your website again and again. How can publishers successfully drive more sign-ups? The very first step is a <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/the-path-to-user-loyalty-and-lifetime-value/\">conversation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How OpenWeb helps publishers convert readers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Digiday, <a href=\"https://blog.fusebill.com/interesting-recent-statistics-on-the-subscription-business-model\">63% of publishers</a> say turning audiences into paying subscribers is a key challenge. Fortunately, OpenWeb has a few ways to help publishers encourage users to sign up— in fact, we <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/case-study/196-lift-in-registrations-a-uk-news-publisher-turns-new-readers-into-loyal-audiences/\">helped one news publisher grow registrations by 196%</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenWeb does this by assessing behavior in real-time to predict a user’s next step and giving them incentives to sign up. Our conversation platform is designed to drive users to subscribe: using a combination of reward mechanisms like reputation points and carefully placed calls-to-action, we make it easy for people to get involved in conversations, stay on-site longer, and become registered users.

Even if paid subscriptions aren’t part of your future plan, driving registrations should be. <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/loyalty-and-conversion-drivers/\">Learn more about how OpenWeb can help drive loyalty and conversions</a>.</p>\n","owHidePublishDate":false,"seo":{"canonical":"https://wordpress.openweb.com/what-all-publishers-can-learn-about-building-a-community-from-subscription-economy/","title":"What All Publishers Can Learn About Building a Community from the Subscription Economy | OpenWeb","metaDesc":"","focuskw":"","metaRobotsNoindex":"index","metaRobotsNofollow":"follow","opengraphAuthor":"","opengraphDescription":"What do Xbox, Audi, and OnlyFans have in common?
