In the United States, 79% of all digital minutes are now spent on mobile devices, <a href=\"https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Press-Releases/2020/11/Comscore-Research-Captures-Evolving-Consumer-Mobile-Behavior\">according to Comscore</a>. A big chunk of that time goes on digital content, with 82% of views of news and information now coming from mobile.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Publishers are seeing the same trend, with <a href=\"https://www.stateofdigitalpublishing.com/opinion/native-apps/\">State of Digital Publishing reporting</a> that 70-80% of views now come from mobile devices. Small surprise, then, that many publishers are retooling their digital platforms to be mobile-first, to meet their readers’ changing consumption habits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But is there more in it for publishers than just maintaining the status quo? A growing body of evidence says that mobile-first publishing doesn’t just help to retain existing audiences. It also creates more opportunities to engage audiences in conversation — in turn increasing their loyalty and generating more revenue.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-30-18-font-size\">Apps can outstrip mobile web for audience engagement</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest question around mobile audience engagement has always been around whether it’s better to go down the responsive website route or invest in a mobile app. And while responsive websites are now a no-brainer for publishers, given that the majority of views come from mobile, there are also extremely good arguments for offering a separate app:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>App users are always logged in</strong>: Readers are automatically logged in when they access the app, rather than having to manually log in when they go to the website. More logged-in readers means more opportunity to personalize content to the individual user, which is proven to increase the amount of time spent reading and the number of articles read.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Apps boost paid subscriptions</strong>: If a reader goes to the effort of installing an app, it means they’re already fans of the content, which makes it easier to convert them to a paid subscription. French newspaper <em>Le Parisien</em> <a href=\"https://blogarchive.wan-ifra.org/2020/09/24/le-parisien-doubles-its-digital-subscribers-sets-goal-of-200000\">told WAN-IFRA in 2020</a> that more than 50% of their subscriber conversions now come from the newspaper’s app.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>They also drive retention</strong>: App users become engaged fans who want to stick around. The <em>Washington Post</em> <a href=\"https://www.adweek.com/media/the-washington-post-amps-up-its-app-strategy-to-drive-more-subscribers/\">told AdWeek in March 2021</a> that subscribers who use its app to consume content stay subscribed for longer and tend to read more articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And they’re a great source of first-party data</strong>: Logged-in app users are a rich source of data about what readers are specifically interested in, particularly if they go on to leave comments. As we <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/the-death-of-the-third-party-cookie-why-now-is-the-time-to-plan-your-first-party-data-strategy\">head towards a cookieless future</a>, first-party data from known users will be essential to publishers’ ad revenue strategies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-30-18-font-size\">Enabling quality in-app conversations with OpenWeb’s mobile SDKs</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mobile apps are great for increasing engagement, subscriptions, loyalty, and ad revenue, but there’s even more to it than that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the biggest drivers of audience engagement is the ability not just to <em>consume</em> but also to <em>interact</em> — with the content itself, with other readers, and with editorial teams. In fact, we’ve found that users who are active in the comments section <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/the-comments-is-more-valuable-than-you-think\">spend up to&nbsp;3.6x more time on-site</a>&nbsp;than non-engaged users.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means a sophisticated third-party commenting system, like <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/openwebos\">OpenWebOS</a>, can be a force multiplier of the value that mobile apps already deliver. Here are just a few of the ways publishers can use OpenWebOS to attract, manage, retain and grow the value of a mobile app audience:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Enable conversations on any app platform</strong>: Our mobile software development kit (SDKs) let publishers implement our Conversations module in Android, iOS or React-native apps, to create a fully-functional and customizable commenting system for app users. Now, app users can get involved in the conversation just as easily as desktop and mobile web users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keep conversation civil with multi-layered moderation</strong>: Encourage high-quality conversations that users will want to read, engage with, participate in and come back to. Our powerful hybrid of AI-powered and human moderation identifies and filters out toxic comments so the conversation remains both civil and brand-safe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Enable personalized ads</strong>: Maximize the monetization capabilities of the app’s comments section, using <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/openwebos/activate/\">first-party data to personalize ads to users</a> in the Conversations module. OpenWeb mobile SDKs allow for both banner and interstitial ads, creating powerful opportunities for brands to be seen by the right people at the right time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"has-30-18-font-size\">Maximize audience engagement on mobile with OpenWeb</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no going back to the desktop: mobile is now overwhelmingly the way audiences want to consume content. And for publishers, that’s a good thing — particularly given the higher levels of engagement and retention enabled by mobile apps. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Savvy publishers can capitalize on that by making the mobile app a place for quality conversation: one where readers can not only get the content they want, but also enrich it with their own views, and enjoy the company of a community of like-minded people. For publishers, that’s a recipe for loyal, long-term readers — and improved revenues.
