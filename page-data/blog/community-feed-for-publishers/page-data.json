The new platform brings together quality conversations, relevant content, and user posts in a safe and immersive environment. With the new product, users can stay longer and engage more, creating increased value for publishers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“With media consumption at all-time highs and the public seeking safer places to engage, OpenWeb is creating powerful solutions that also benefit publishers. Community Feed combines a social-feed-like experience with higher standards for quality, and encourages users to discover more content and conversations without the toxicity,” said Nadav Shoval, OpenWeb’s CEO and Co-Founder. “Community Feed creates a virtuous cycle that keeps audiences on-site longer, encourages quality discourse and discovery, and supports publisher sustainability.”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https://www.openweb.com/uploads/2020/07/Community-Feed-2-1-1024x768.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-5832\" srcset=\"https://www.openweb.com/uploads/2020/07/Community-Feed-2-1-1024x768.png 1024w, https://www.openweb.com/uploads/2020/07/Community-Feed-2-1-300x225.png 300w, https://www.openweb.com/uploads/2020/07/Community-Feed-2-1-768x576.png 768w, https://www.openweb.com/uploads/2020/07/Community-Feed-2-1-1140x855.png 1140w, https://www.openweb.com/uploads/2020/07/Community-Feed-2-1.png 1280w, https://www.openweb.com/uploads/2020/07/Community-Feed-2-1-300x225@2x.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Features &amp; Highlights of OpenWeb’s Community Feed:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Journalists, editors, and users can create topical posts that live outside of individual articles, allowing conversations to live and thrive longer.&nbsp;</li><li>Customized moderation capabilities and rigorous standards ensure the highest quality dialogue between users and journalists.&nbsp;</li><li>Advanced recommendation algorithms surface engagement-driven, trending, and relevant content into a seamless social experience. 43% of commenters are reading similar articles discovered through the Feed during the same session.</li><li>Users can easily navigate between content and conversations, and hashtags allow commenters to easily find similar articles and conversations.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenWeb, which announced it was changing its name from Spot.IM a few weeks ago has quickly become the leader for premium publishers to engage and retain audiences.
