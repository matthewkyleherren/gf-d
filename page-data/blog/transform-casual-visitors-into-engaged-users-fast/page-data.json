With OpenWeb’s tools, publishers can make it easy for their website visitors to join the Conversation—and even turn those users into loyal, engaged fans.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The challenge: They don’t know what to write</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>The solution: Community Questions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jumping into a Conversation may feel overwhelming for some, so publishers should make it easy for anyone to join. One way to do this is by featuring a Community Question to lead the Conversation. Community Questions sit on top of the Conversation, so they’re hard to miss. Be sure to give readers a clear set of choices, as opposed to asking an open-ended question—this makes it easier to reply, and encourages more people to weigh in.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MMQeRP9ddWq3CFnpSmLdPC6aVlJ9KSmtqCikH2PhOuqGyEeNKV75pqy9KnDst1WGUCzPnw5AGkUsJa1ofhtXL8BaWbBSRVcVF-l8Utcm4FZb__debpR4TWvQiZNDs6lJ-WVZ7D-k\" alt=\"\" width=\"542\" height=\"500\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>The challenge: They don’t have time to comment</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>The solution: Reactions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Many users are multitasking: they’re reading an article while commuting, or in-between tasks at work. But even if they don’t have time to comment, it’s likely that they have an opinion about the content they just read. That’s where Reactions comes in handy. Since it only takes one click, Reactions provides a simple way for readers to interact with your content. In turn, you get valuable first-party data from your community and a pulse of your community’s setinement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter is-resized\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/hHK05BvtWqy4pj6Bq5Fjhs3X576a_WhfiZbKxtGWQ32eQk7enuph_bFrlG5fldz1PZtizRO76J07EKXeTLnALkIjned5e_XuBxZGNochw0NtpnRGZ8iHJfgjKLvqRkqkG9tYM0s7\" alt=\"\" width=\"584\" height=\"415\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>The challenge: They’re worried about trolls</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2>The solution: effective, multi-layered moderation</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If a user witnesses<a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/how-the-online-disinhibition-effect-impacts-online-conversations/\"> toxicity</a> in a Conversation, they’re a lot less likely to join in. Publishers using effective moderation can encourage quality conversations where new users feel welcomed. OpenWeb’s multi-layered moderation platform understands the nuances of conversation and—thanks to our integration with <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/openweb-improves-community-health-with-real-time-feedback-powered-by-jigsaws-perspective-api/\">Jigsaw’s Perspective API</a>—can detect potentially harmful comments and encourage users to edit them in real-time. Additionally, publishers can—and should—review their moderation policy regularly and adjust as needed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><figure class=\"aligncenter\"><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/Xcm993A3BEGIVnFFf1-9repZDr6OzWOeAC3w9mkA4DALmdeMT3e4_FSg6Wrj4TEsaPFyRHVJmT5JhrXhzABuKk5EdvSGTG-FsFYXqdw_KR27OCMtqUf6IqrC5Gdizi7WIU6eyJz-\" alt=\"\"/></figure></div>\n\n\n\n<h2>What about <em>new</em> users? We have something special for them, too.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Users who are new to a publisher’s community might need a little extra guidance. At OpenWeb, we want all new users to feel welcomed and excited to join their new community.
