Effective moderation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we at OpenWeb know that publishers who get this right grow engaged, loyal communities that keep coming back to engage in these quality conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, we’re taking a look at how, during and after the attacks on the U.S. Capitol, our&nbsp; moderation technology aided in mitigating toxicity and creating healthier interactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Our AI-driven moderation platform adapts in real-time—stopping toxic comments in their tracks</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In the aftermath of the Capitol attacks, we saw more people spending time in the comment section reading about it, seeing what others were saying about it, and discussing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Across our network, we saw a <strong>36.6%</strong> increase in people spending time in the comment section as the events on January 6th unfolded, and&nbsp;</li><li>we saw notable spikes in the number of people commenting (<strong>84.4%</strong>) and replying to comments (<strong>77.4%</strong>) on January 7th.&nbsp;</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>But news like this can spark toxicity. During this period (from January 6-7), our <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/quantifying-quality-and-safety-online/\">Conversation Survey Score</a>—which tracks the ebb and flow of toxicity based on feedback from users across our network—dropped by <strong>23%</strong> compared to the previous week’s average.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, the percentage of comments approved to be published–our <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/quantifying-quality-and-safety-online/\">comment approval rate</a>–dropped by <strong>9%</strong>.*</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does this all mean?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The approval rate dropped as toxicity increased. If the approval rate stayed the same while toxicity increased, that would mean toxic comments were falling through the cracks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, <strong>our technology adapted and prevented offensive comments from seeing the light of day</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On January 8th—right after we saw the initial dip— the Conversation Survey Score began rising again, indicating that the quality of conversations increased—which is exactly what we want to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How does our moderation platform work?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our AI-driven moderation allows us to keep improving our platform to support healthy conversations. We integrate with <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/openweb-improves-community-health-with-real-time-feedback-powered-by-jigsaws-perspective-api/\">Jigsaw’s Perspective API</a>, a tool that can identify and predict if a comment is toxic to simplify the moderation process. This tool features a “nudge” concept that encourages users to edit potentially harmful comments in real-time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, we use a proprietary moderation algorithm that can identify and remove behaviors that can put a community at risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This multi-layered platform—along with the continuous feedback loop we have in our Conversation Survey—allows us to improve and adapt our moderation to any situation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Publishers can rest assured that toxicity is kept in check no matter what topic is dominating the news—and in this environment, quality conversations can flourish.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The path forward: publishers can be hosts of civil discourse</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We believe that publishers have the power to create environments where readers engage in quality conversations—even when a polarizing topic dominates the news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moderation lets publishers overcome toxicity and host the quality conversations absent from so much of the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>With great power comes great responsibility.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since we know that <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/the-year-in-comments-readers-spent-more-time-in-the-comments-section-as-major-news-broke/\">more users spend time engaging in the comment section</a> as major news breaks, it’s important for publishers to be prepared for a surge in activity—and have a solution to manage any potentially harmful comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to using moderation technology, here’s how publishers can encourage healthy conversations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Journalists and writers should participate in the conversation. Interact with readers by addressing their questions and concerns—and let them know you’re listening.</li><li>Consider posting a featured question to your community to guide the conversation.</li><li>Finally, don’t hide from toxicity. When polarizing news breaks, there is an even greater need to be a part of the conversation.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/quantifying-quality-and-safety-online/\">Learn
