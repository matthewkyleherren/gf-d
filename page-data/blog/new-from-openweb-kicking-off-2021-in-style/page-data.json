Our latest release includes a new style guide, <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/introducing-read-only-conversation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Read-Only Conversation</a>, performance enhancements and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Improved design and user experience</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At OpenWeb, we believe that creating inviting spaces for users to interact promotes engaging and quality conversations. After months of planning and design explorations, our new streamlined style guide is now being rolled-out across our network.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new designs include a range of elements within the Conversation and User Profiles. From menus, modals to buttons and typography—we got it all covered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The enhancement also included features that promote journalist involvement in the conversations. Now your staff or editorial team can have unique themes or colors for their system-generated initial avatars. And badges can be customized to have full color or just an outline.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/WnSK7G_WyJz8zBkzP4jiDNd6H6Xm8zTG_rH8LooasaX8XAUIMB-wH72I-p2RPd5zrWgj-pzFj6ERttDsn_UDn8BrXUX7d1gmVToKF5eK8ZwqRYhZPD5pADDdcS8V9rnvO3yfuFxL\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>A significant number of active users appreciate an opportunity to converse with experts such as journalists or editors to form a deeper bond with the publisher. Using badges can directly impact active user engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These design updates will ensure all of our components:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Have a universal look and feel</li><li>Are WCAG 2.1 AA accessible&nbsp;</li><li>Could be quickly adapted based on partner needs</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gain better ROI on your moderation efforts&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the right moderation tools publishers can better manage the health of their communities, gain increased benefits from their moderation efforts—ultimately allowing for more respectful interactions and fewer harmful comments.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also want you to employ your moderation resources where it matters. With this in mind, OpenWeb is now offering a <strong>Read-Only Conversation</strong> feature for our partners. The feature enables Moderators and Admins to turn off commenting by article after a certain period of time or at their discretion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img src=\"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p2zVdmpskHZKlFrG-aOFZ4G4W8fZfAovU6GAXvHw8JtJlYUqBtgt43WDxd4R45kj4f4YlBtvopZv8nF_JtkM8hTNwbLXmB5cNiwzUOfvwETpF1ynohiAH2rgfypSBI5LhN1hLeYe\" alt=\"\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>You can now turn this on for a specific article via the gear icon on the Conversation unit, or globally for all the articles within the OpenWeb admin dashboard. Read more about the feature <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/introducing-read-only-conversation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Augmenting real-time interactions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Our real-time typing indicators and avatars play a significant role in catching user attention and improving engagement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We now display the total number of engaged users in the conversation—right at the top —instantly boosting more interest. Previously this displayed the avatars of registered users only.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You also have the ability to disable this within the OpenWeb admin panel or ask your Partner Success Manager to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"851\" height=\"245\" src=\"https://www.openweb.com/uploads/2021/01/image-3.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6877\" srcset=\"https://www.openweb.com/uploads/2021/01/image-3.png 851w, https://www.openweb.com/uploads/2021/01/image-3-300x86.png 300w, https://www.openweb.com/uploads/2021/01/image-3-768x221.png 768w, https://www.openweb.com/uploads/2021/01/image-3-300x86@2x.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 851px) 100vw, 851px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>For partners that allow guest commenting, our Say Control is now dramatically less real-estate hungry. Showing only the comment field by default and expanding on click to allow guests to quickly add a new comment, and enter their name/nickname to participate in the conversation. We also save their temporary nickname for their next comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This enhancement reduces friction, and creates a cleaner and more focused user experience, prompting guests to take action.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"197\" src=\"https://www.openweb.com/uploads/2021/01/gif3.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-6883\"/></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>We no longer generate random usernames (<em>remember greenturtle?</em>), so this also helps in enhancing user identity by creating avatars that are based on the user’s name.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Performance, performance, performance!&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s our mantra for 2021! We are on a mission to make our product the lightest in the market. Below are a few performance enhancements that are part of this release to make loading experience faster and smoother:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>More lazy-loaded modules than before</li><li>Improved boot logic&nbsp;</li><li>Usage of shared SVG icons&nbsp;</li><li>Skeleton loader for user tooltip</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>We have also improved how we treat link embeds within comments. For example, links to Facebook posts now use native embeds instead of a generic link preview.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last but not least, on the data side of things we now offer new event listeners for the click on cog menu, message context menu and more. <a href=\"https://developers.openweb.com/docs/event-listener-reference\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">See our Developers Hub for a full list of supported event listeners</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>These features are being rolled out gradually across the OpenWeb network. If you need more information or have any questions, please reach out to your Partner Success Manager.</em></p>\n","owHidePublishDate":false,"seo":{"canonical":"https://wordpress.openweb.com/new-from-openweb-kicking-off-2021-in-style/","title":"New from OpenWeb: Kicking Off 2021 in Style | OpenWeb","metaDesc":"","focuskw":"","metaRobotsNoindex":"index","metaRobotsNofollow":"follow","opengraphAuthor":"","opengraphDescription":"As we usher in a brand new year, we have so much to share with you!
