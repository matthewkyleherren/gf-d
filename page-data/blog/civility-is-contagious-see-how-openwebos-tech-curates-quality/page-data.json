Effective moderation—like OpenWeb’s AI and machine learning-powered technology—reduces toxicity, leading to engaging, high-quality conversations. And our experience shows again and again: quality is the best way to <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/transform-casual-visitors-into-engaged-users-fast/\">turn your casual readers into returning, registered users</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the ways we do this is by surfacing the most productive comments to the top of the conversation using our “Best” Sorting algorithm. This extremely influential feature is improving the quality of conversations across the OpenWeb network. <strong>See how it works here</strong>:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video controls src=\"https://www.openweb.com/uploads/2021/05/OpenWeb_Best-Sorting_Feature_Video_May-2021-1.mp4\"></video></figure>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Best” Sorting” automatically curates the comments section by identifying and exposing high-quality content while minimizing risk exposure.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Civility is contagious</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to one<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2056305118793404\"> report</a>, “When people are exposed to civil content, they are much more likely to civil content themselves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And at OpenWeb, we’ve seen this in action. And civil, high-quality conversations yield better results for our publisher partners—including <strong>35%</strong> more time on-site and <strong>200%</strong> more pages viewed by active users. In fact, there is a <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/how-does-your-community-impact-your-bottom-line/\">direct correlation</a> between lifts in civility and lifts in pageviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br><a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/influencing-quality-with-the-best-sorting-algorithm/\">Learn more about “Best” Sorting and how we’re changing the game for publishers with quality conversations</a>.</p>\n","owHidePublishDate":false,"seo":{"canonical":"https://wordpress.openweb.com/civility-is-contagious-see-how-openwebos-tech-curates-quality/","title":"Online Civil Discourse is Contagious: OpenWebOS Curates Quality | OpenWeb","metaDesc":"Online civil discourse is contagious.
