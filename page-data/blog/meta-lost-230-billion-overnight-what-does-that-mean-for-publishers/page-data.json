The stock of its parent company, Meta, fell by 26.4%, knocking $230 billion off its market value overnight.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cause? Most analysts agree it’s Apple—specifically, Apple&#8217;s new privacy policies, which allows iPhone users to opt-out of being tracked by the apps they use. When Meta&#8217;s CFO announced that those policies would cost the company $10 billion in sales in 2022, the stock began to tumble.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the core of this story is something marketers have been fretting about for years: the end of the third-party cookie regime that has been the be-all-end-all of internet advertising for over a decade, and the fuel to the fire of Facebook’s historic growth. That coming reality has been discussed endlessly on marketing blogs, but as of yesterday, it&#8217;s officially front-page news.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Between Apple&#8217;s new policies and Google&#8217;s looming cookie phase-out, the digital advertising ecosystem is going through its most significant upheaval in years (which, for an industry defined by upheaval, is saying something). Meta&#8217;s decline—the biggest one-day retreat in US history—is just the most spectacular symptom of a change that affects thousands of companies all over the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-30-18-font-size\">So: what&#8217;s it all mean for publishers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the immediate future, third-party cookies certainly still have value. But publishers who fail to develop a game plan for the coming post-cookie world are setting themselves up for massive trouble down the line. And any post-cookie game plan would be incomplete without a focus on first-party data strategies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First-party data—data collected directly from your readers, as they read and interact with your content—is just as effective as third-party data when it comes to targeting readers. It also happens to be less invasive, and much cheaper to acquire. And unlike third-party data, it&#8217;s not going anywhere anytime soon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At OpenWeb, we believe the best route to first-party data is through building a community rooted in healthy conversation––the kinds of vibrant, non-toxic discussions that keep readers coming back. Active communities provide opportunities for better advertising experiences as third-party cookies fade away—and valuable first-party signals about what&#8217;s working (and what isn&#8217;t) that empower publishers to craft their content accordingly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the basis of a content strategy that readers back more often, and acquiring still more first-party data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Best-in-class social experiences, re-engagement tools, and identity solutions help publishers build the kinds of communities they need in order to compete in the years ahead. Let Meta&#8217;s very bad day be a warning: the post-cookie world is coming for us all. The best thing to do is plan ahead.</p>\n","owHidePublishDate":false,"seo":{"canonical":"https://wordpress.openweb.com/meta-lost-230-billion-overnight-what-does-that-mean-for-publishers/","title":"Meta Lost $230 Billion Overnight.
