The glaring omission? <strong>The Comments Section.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>That’s right—hosting a comments section is perhaps the most valuable tool for boosting retention and engagement. And far too often, it’s overlooked.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to OpenWeb’s innovative approach to Quality Conversations, supported by <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/moderation-and-safety/\">our multi-layered, comprehensive quality framework</a> and <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/nudges-revisited-online-comments-are-getting-more-polite-thanks-to-real-time-feedback/\">our AI/Machine-learning technology developed with Google Jigsaw’s Perspective API</a>, comments are quickly doing away with their stigma as a breeding ground for toxic trolls.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Publishers who build a thriving, active community centered around healthy, robust conversations have a real competitive edge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why? Hosting a conversation helps publishers:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Boost engagement</li><li>Grow registrations</li><li>Gather<a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/google-kills-cookies-for-good-and-publishers-need-a-plan-now/\"> first-party data</a>, and</li><li>Drive better retention.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>With retention, engagement, and registrations top-of-mind for most publishers today, let’s take a look at some of the most important ways that comments help drive an effective retention strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A comments section gives your users a powerful way to interact</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With a thriving comments section, you are moving beyond the publisher:reader relationship and facilitating user:user connections. This opens up many new ways to facilitate interaction while keeping readers engaged, on-site, and returning over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Across the OpenWeb network, users who are active in the comments section stick around longer, spending up to <strong>3.6x more time on-site</strong> than non-engaged users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through the conversation, users interact by reading comments, replying to others, <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/reactions-get-a-pulse-on-your-community-with-interactive-polls/\">interacting with polls</a>, and more. OpenWeb’s features seamlessly automate engagement funnels that reward and leverage these interactions, inviting readers to return and interact more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Comments helps grow a loyal fan base </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Good conversations make you, the publisher, the host of a community—and a community can be a valuable, significant part of your readers’ lives. When your audience knows they’re contributing to a greater good, and that they’re forging real human connections, they’re more likely to keep contributing and continue to attract new recruits to the conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Publishers can incentivize positive behavior by using rewards—like <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/loyalty-and-conversion-drivers/\">reputation points</a>—to encourage users to post thoughtful comments. Publishers with especially strong communities can even empower their best users to become <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/blog/4-ways-community-moderation-benefits-publishers/\">community moderators</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don’t miss this: Hosting a Community founded on high-quality Comments should be a major part of your growth strategy</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Retention will always be a priority for publishers looking to grow—and comments are essential for helping boost other KPIs like engagement, registrations, and time spent on-site, just to name a few. Comments are a tool simply too valuable to be overlooked.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/loyalty-and-conversion-drivers/\">Read more about how OpenWeb helps publishers build thriving communities</a> or <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/contact/\">contact us</a> to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>*Participation is defined as leaving a new comment, replying to an existing comment, liking or reacting to a comment, or simply reading the comments.</p>\n","owHidePublishDate":false,"seo":{"canonical":"https://wordpress.openweb.com/the-comments-is-more-valuable-than-you-think/","title":"The Comments Section is More Valuable Than You Think | OpenWeb","metaDesc":"Hosting a comments section is a valuable tool for boosting retention & engagement.
