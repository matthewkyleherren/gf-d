Brands then use these insights to better address their target audience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of data privacy laws and increased concerns from consumers about how their data is shared, many web browsers have begun a <a href=\"https://www.wrayward.com/articles/the-death-of-the-third-party-cookie-what-it-means-for-advertising\">phased removal</a> of third-party cookies. The biggest player to move in this direction, Google – representing about 66% of global desktop browser market share – announced earlier this year that their complete phase-out of third party cookies would be completed by 2022. With that deadline in mind, the clock is ticking for publishers and advertisers alike.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the benefits of first-party data in a cookie-less world?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/first-party-data-insights/\">First-party data insights</a> – the data that you collect <em>directly</em> from your users – has several major benefits over third-party data. For one, publishers already have a powerful source of first-party data: their communities. The more your users interact within your community, the more valuable insights you have to create better experiences for them, increasing key metrics like time on site. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Understanding your first-party data also makes it easier to align the right advertisers with your users, creating a contextualized ad experience that ensures better targeting. For publishers, first-party data can even help inform your editorial strategy, with insights on trending topics and overall engagement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, your first-party data strategy<em> is</em> your community. An active, thriving community will give you the insights you need to drive lasting loyalty and retention.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How do I get started with a first-party data strategy?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>No two communities are the same, so it’s important to have a custom data management solution that has the ability to take first-party community data – including conversation topics, interests, engagement, and more – and quickly make it actionable in a way that helps drive your business goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/first-party-data-insights/\">OpenWeb&#8217;s DMP</a> works with the existing systems you already have in place, helping you manage community data and create custom segments that bring more value to your advertising strategies. <a href=\"https://www.openweb.com/first-party-data-insights/\">Learn more about OpenWeb’s first-party data insights and DMP</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Kick off your first-party data strategy today</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The impending death of the third-party cookie is a valuable opportunity to create elevated user experiences that drive loyalty and retention.
